## Flutter 202
Flutter is Google's UI toolkit to build visually stunning applications for **mobile**, **web** and **desktop applications** - **all in a single codebase!** Bringing your app to life has never been faster with it's fully customizable widgets to build native interfaces in a minute. Build expressive and beautiful UI's for your users with rich motion APIs and smooth natural scrolling. And with Flutter, you can avoid keeping multiple code bases for iOS and Android! What's not to love? ü§©

## Installation
To work seamlessly on Flutter, you can opt to install either Android Studio or Visual Studio Code with Flutter and Dart SDK as well as the latest Android SDK set up. All the instructions and relevant links are provided [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install). **IF YOU ARE UNABLE TO INSTALL OR HAVE ANY DIFFICULTY WHATSOEVER IN INSTALLATION, PLEASE CONTACT US BEFORE THE WORKSHOP.** Taking up a session which involves installation during the workshop takes time and it would not allow us to teach to the best of our abilities. We will not be able to help you on the day of the workshop if you have not installed the required software.
## This is a BYOC event üíª
We'll be giving you hands-on experience on how to work with Flutter. So the event is *Bring Your Own Computer* workshop, your Laptops will be of great help here. Also, please note that running Android Studio with any system **below 4GB RAM** will be a tedious process. We reccommend having a laptop with minimum 4GB RAM. Running Visual Studio Code will be a breeze however and we reccommend you opt for that.
